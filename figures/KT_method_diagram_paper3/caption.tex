\label{fig:diagram} Schematic diagrams of three variations of the inverse kinematic distance method. In each diagram, we show a map of residuals from a flat rotation curve (left quarter-circle), mock PPD and PPV data along a single sightline (narrow vertical and horizontal panels), and the velocity structure of the ISM along the same sightline.
