\label{fig:diagram} Schematic diagrams of three variations of inverse kinematic distance. In each diagram, we show a map of residuals from a flat rotation curve (left quarter-circle), mock PPD and PPV data along a single sightline (narrow vertical and horizontal panels), and the mean ($\vlos\left(x_0, y_0, i, j\right)$) and standard deviation ($\sigma_v\left(x_0, y_0, i, j\right)$) of the velocity along the line of sight.
