\label{fig:outliers}
\textbf{(a)} The distribution of residuals per uncertainty (\textit{standardized} residuals) between the observed and KT-derived line-of-sight velocities of HMSFRs (filled histogram), with an appropriately scaled standard normal distribution for reference (empty histogram). We consider HMSFRs with $\vert \Delta v / \sigma \vert > 3$ to be outliers. In all three panels, outliers are denoted in orange and non-outliers are denoted in blue. 
\textbf{(b)} The distribution of the HMSFRs' Galactic longitudes. HMSFRs (outliers and non-outliers) with $\glon < 35^\circ$ are outlined with a dashed black line.
\textbf{(c)} The distribution of the HMSFRs' Galactocentric radii. HMSFRs (outliers and non-outliers) with $\glon < 35^\circ$ are outlined with a dashed black line.
\textbf{(d)} The locations of the outliers and non-outliers in heliocentric Cartesian coordinates, where $\mathrm{X_{HC}}$ increases towards $\glon=0^\circ$ and $\mathrm{Y_{HC}}$ increases towards $\glon=90^\circ$.
