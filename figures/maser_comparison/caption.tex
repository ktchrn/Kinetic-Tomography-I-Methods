\label{fig:hmsfr_comparison}
The three panels show the residuals from flat rotation of the \citet{2009ApJ...700..137R} HMSFR line-of-sight velocity observations on the y-axis and residuals from flat rotation of the values of the \citet{Clemens:1985dp} rotation curve (left panel), the unregularized kinetic tomography solution (middle panel), and the regularized kinetic tomography solution (right panel) at the positions of the HMSFRs on the x-axis.
