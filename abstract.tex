We have developed a method for deriving the distribution of the Milky Way interstellar medium as a function of longitude, latitude, distance and line-of-sight velocity from maps of reddening as a function of longitude, latitude, and distance and maps of line emission as a function of longitude, latitude, and line-of-sight velocity. 
We have applied this method to datasets covering much of the Northern Galactic plane.
The distribution produced by this method correctly reproduces the line-of-sight velocities of high-mass star forming regions with known distances from \citet{Reid:2014km} and qualitatively agrees with a range of lower-dimensional results from the Milky Way kinematics literature.
